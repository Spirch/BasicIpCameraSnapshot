# BasicIpCameraSnapshot
Basic web application that request pictures from ip cameras and return a grid view of them, showing 1/4 resolution of each picture

See the included appsettings.json for a simple example using 4 hikvision cameras

Go to host:port/IpCam to view the grid, click on a picture to view the full resolution

weather overlay text need a user with configuration permission otherwise live view is enough

I have coded / included two examples one that use xml (Environment Canada) and another one that use json (The weather network)

Should be able to run on windows (confirmed) / linux (confirmed) / mac
